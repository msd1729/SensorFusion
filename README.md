SensorFusion
============

Implemented a Sensor Fusion for rescue hoist with Sensor Fusion box attached on the hoist.
 Used Single board computer (SBC), color camera, NIR camera, Wi-Fi module, and receiver module in the Sensor Fusion box.
Basically, all devices (cameras, sensors, communication modules) are connected with SBC.
Understood video streaming over Wi-Fi in real-time. Media server will be operated in the SBC and iPad will connect to the media
server over Wi-Fi.
 Designed a protocol to control the cameras from iPad app.
 Length of wire cable from hoist will be measured and SBC's server will send it through Wi-Fi to iPad. iPad app will display the data
in real-time, too.
 Developed and designed the iPad application for this Sensor Fusion Project using Objective C in Xcode.


p.s. The server used for this application is the private server of 'Breeze Eastern' company. No video will be displayed when the app is launched.
But you can try using different server that has live video streaming for this application.
